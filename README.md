## 🌌 What is Phext?

Phext isn't your typical text format.  
It's **multidimensional text navigation** — a hybrid of filesystems, coordinate planes, and pure, unbounded scrolls.

This extension allows you to **read, edit, and navigate Phext files (`.phext`) directly inside VS Code** — no more flipping through endless files or struggling to manage deep structures manually.

You simply:
- 🔢 Enter your coordinate (in beautiful 9D form).
- ✨ Instantly load the corresponding scroll.
- 📝 Edit directly, and save seamlessly.

## 📍 How Coordinates Work

Coordinates are expressed as:

```
Library.Shelf.Series / Collection.Volume.Book / Chapter.Section.Scroll
```

Example:

```
1.2.3/4.5.6/7.8.9
```

You're essentially navigating inside a **multiverse of text**.

## 🚀 Why Phext?

Because sometimes...  
**hierarchies aren't enough.**  
Because sometimes...  
**your universe deserves 9 dimensions.**

Phext gives you:

- A coordinate-based structure instead of directories.
- Natural sparse storage for massive datasets.
- A native way to represent multidimensional archives, text scrolls, or infinite nested documents.
